# LUKS configuration
enable_luks: true

# Encrypted home directory configuration
# TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Partition 2 uses entire disk, need to resize first
# To enable later:
#   1. Boot from live USB/CD
#   2. Shrink partition 2 to 64GB using gparted or parted
#   3. Create partition 3 with remaining space
#   4. Set luks_encrypt_home: true and run playbook again
luks_encrypt_home: false
luks_home_device: "/dev/nvme0n1p3"  # Will be set after creating partition 3
# Partition size guidance (for ~250GB NVMe):
# - Boot (/dev/nvme0n1p1): 512MB (FAT32, unencrypted)
# - Root (/dev/nvme0n1p2): Currently 238GB (needs to be shrunk to 64GB)
#   Rationale: Desktop + Docker + packages + buffer for updates (~64GB provides comfortable headroom)
# - Home (/dev/nvme0n1p3): ~185GB remaining (LUKS encrypted, mounted after boot) - NOT YET CREATED

# Samba configuration
enable_samba: true
# Samba uses its own password database (smbpasswd)
# Password is set from samba_armand_passwords[inventory_hostname] in all_secrets.yml
# Set it to match the system password if you want to use the same password
# Future system password changes will sync to Samba automatically
