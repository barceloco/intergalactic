# Secrets file template
# Copy this file to all_secrets.yml (which is gitignored) and fill in your actual values
#
# Usage:
#   cp all_secrets.yml.example all_secrets.yml
#   # Edit all_secrets.yml with your actual keys and secrets

# SSH public keys for the automation user (ansible)
automation_authorized_keys:
  - "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... ansible@control"
  # Add additional keys as needed

# Human user accounts with their SSH public keys
human_users:
  - name: armand
    authorized_keys:
      - "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user@laptop"

# Tailscale authentication key (one-time use key from Tailscale admin console)
tailscale_authkey: "tskey-auth-..."

# Samba passwords for armand user (per-host, for SMB/CIFS file sharing)
# Only needed if enable_samba is true for a host
# Samba uses its own password database (separate from system password)
# Set this to match the system password for user 'armand' if you want to use the same password
# Future system password changes will sync to Samba automatically (unix password sync = yes)
# Add entries for each host that has enable_samba: true
samba_armand_passwords:
  vega: "CHANGE_me."
  rigel: "CHANGE_me."
  # Add more hosts as needed:
  # hostname: "password-here"
# LUKS encrypted home partition passphrase (base64-encoded)
# Minimum: 64 characters (48 bytes of entropy - excellent security)
# Maximum: 512 characters (LUKS limit)
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 48 | head -c 64
# Or: echo -n "your-passphrase" | base64 (ensure output is 64+ chars)
# Only needed if luks_encrypt_home is true for a host
luks_home_passphrase: ""  # Base64-encoded passphrase (64+ characters recommended)
