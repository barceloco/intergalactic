# CRITICAL: ALL hosts in this file MUST use ansible_user: ansible
# This is the automation user created during bootstrap

# For new hosts that haven't been bootstrapped yet, use hosts-bootstrap.yml instead
# 
# RULE: When adding a new host, it MUST use ansible_user: ansible in this file
#       and ansible_user: armand in hosts-bootstrap.yml
