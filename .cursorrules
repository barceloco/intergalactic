# Security Rules - CRITICAL

## NEVER Reduce Security

**YOU MUST NEVER make changes that have security implications:**
- NO reducing safety checks
- NO ignoring signature or key verifications
- NO disabling host key checking
- NO bypassing authentication mechanisms
- NO weakening encryption or cryptographic verification
- NO removing security validations

**If a change would reduce security, you MUST:**
1. Reject the change
2. Explain the security risk
3. Suggest a secure alternative that maintains or improves security

**Security is non-negotiable. When in doubt, choose the more secure option.**
